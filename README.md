Cluster analysis is an important tool for unsupervised learning. Determining the number of clusters K is a difficult problem. Our goal is to explore the different ways which are currently used to determine the optimal number of clusters in k-means.

###Objective:
+ Learn how to think about the solution to a hard problem in unsupervised learning, implement the solution, create and execute a structured work plan
+ Identify/Recognize some challenges that arise in unsupervised learning and understand why determining the optimal number of clusters  is a hard problem
+ Analyze and identify the steps in the code structure in the k-means clustering implementation
+ Be able to generate 4 clustering datasets with different properties
+ Model the mathematical representation of K in all the 4 methods:
  1. Gap Statistic
  2. Elbow
  3. Information theoretic
  4. Avg Silhouette
